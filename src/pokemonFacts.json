    "Ogerpon cannot have its Tera Type be changed under normal circumstances in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet. Even if the game is modified to force Ogerpon to have a different Tera Type, the game will softlock upon trying to Terastallize, forcing the player to restart the console. It shares this distinction with Terapagos. This makes Ogerpon the only Pokémon available in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet incapable of being Stellar-type. Illusion, Imposter, and Transform will also not work if either Ogerpon or the Pokémon with them Terastallizes.",
    "The types of all three non-default masked forms of Ogerpon were unique type combinations prior to their introduction: Wellspring Mask Ogerpon's dual-type Grass/Water was previously unique to Lotad's evolutionary line. Hearthflame Mask Ogerpon's dual-type Grass/Fire was previously unique to Scovillain. Cornerstone Mask Ogerpon's dual-type Grass/Rock was previously unique to Lileep's evolutionary line.",
    "Ogerpon in its Wellspring Mask form is the first Water-type Pokémon with a 100% female ratio. The same is true for its Cornerstone Mask form and the Rock type.",
    "If Ogerpon is sent out during the battle against Pecharunt at the end of the Mochi Mayhem epilogue, Ogerpon will recognize it and react with distress and anger, yelling out \"GRAH! Pon PON!!!\" at it.",
    "Archaludon was revealed during the Pokémon Presents that aired on August 8th, 2023.",
    "Archaludon is the only Pokémon with a base stat total of 600 that is not a Legendary, Mythical, Mega Evolution, or pseudo-legendary Pokémon. The Japanese Pokémon fandom includes it in a separate, but similar group to pseudo-legendary Pokémon, namely the \"600 club\" (600族).",
    "Hydrapple is the only one of Applin's evolutionary relatives to be a third-stage evolution. Hydrapple appears in the Blueberry Pokedex, despite none of its evolutionary relatives appearing in it, which also makes it the only member of Applin's evolutionary relatives with this distinction.",
    "Hydrapple's existence was indicated before the release of The Indigo Disk by the fact that Dipplin could use the Eviolite.",
    "Hydrapple is the only Pokémon that requires a TM to obtain, as Dipplin cannot learn Dragon Cheer without it.",
    "As Dynamax and Gigantamax are exclusive to Pokémon Sword and Shield, Hydrapple is the only one of Applin's final forms to not have a Gigantamax form.",
    "Before the official reveal of Gouging Fire, a sketch of an imaginary Pokémon similar to it appeared in the Scarlet Book in Pokémon Scarlet as an amalgam of the Legendary beasts (Raikou, Entei, and Suicune).",
    "Gouging Fire is the only Paradox Pokémon whose signature move is a status move.",
    "Gouging Fire is the heaviest Paradox Pokémon overall.",
    "Gouging Fire can be considered the counterpart of Iron Boulder as both were not revealed until The Indigo Disk was released.",
    "Before the official reveal of Raging Bolt, a sketch of an imaginary Pokémon similar to it appeared in the Scarlet Book in Pokémon Scarlet as an amalgam of the Legendary beasts (Raikou, Entei, and Suicune).",
    "Raging Bolt is the tallest and heaviest Electric-type Pokémon.",
    "Raging Bolt is the tallest Paradox Pokémon overall.",
    "Raging Bolt can be considered the counterpart of Iron Crown as both were revealed to the public on August 8, 2023, via Pokémon Presents.",
    "Before the official reveal of Iron Boulder, a sketch of an imaginary Pokémon similar to it appeared in the Violet Book in Pokémon Violet as an amalgam of the Swords of Justice (Cobalion, Terrakion, and Virizion).",
    "Iron Boulder can be considered the counterpart of Gouging Fire as both were not revealed until The Indigo Disk was released.",
    "Excluding Cornerstone Mask Ogerpon, Iron Boulder is the only Rock type that is unable to learn Rock Slide.",
    "Before the official reveal of Iron Crown, a sketch of an imaginary Pokémon similar to it appeared in the Violet Book in Pokémon Violet as an amalgam of the Swords of Justice (Cobalion, Terrakion, and Virizion).",
    "Iron Crown can be considered the counterpart of Raging Bolt as both were revealed to the public on August 8, 2023, via Pokémon Presents.",
    "Before the official reveal of Terapagos, a sketch of its Stellar Form appeared in the Scarlet BookS/Violet BookV, drawn by Heath in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet.",
    "Terapagos has several similarities to Eternatus. Both are Legendary Pokémon that are responsible for the special type of transformation (Dynamax/Gigantamax and Terastallization) found within their respective regions of origin (Galar and Paldea) after entering a state of dormancy sometime in the distant past. They also both have transformations exclusive to them related to these phenomena increasing their stats (Eternatus's Eternamax form and Terapagos's Stellar Form, though the former is unobtainable) and can absorb the energy needed to use these transformations from other Pokémon, thereby rendering them unavailable. They also each have a form that cannot be used by the player in battle with programmed stats (Eternatus's Eternamax form and Terapagos's Normal form, the latter of which can be brought into battle but not used due to its unsurpressable ability). Both of them were also introduced in a game which would receive DLC and whose game mascots comprise a Legendary duo.",
    "In the closed captions of the initial TV Tokyo broadcast of HZ023, Terapagos was mistakenly referred to as コダイカメ Kodaikame (from 古代亀 kodaikame, literally \"ancient turtle\"). This mirrors its internal name from Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, where Terapagos is also referred to as \"kodaikame\".",
    "Terapagos is the only Pokémon with an EV yield total of more than three, with its Terastal Form having a total of four. Terapagos is also the only Pokémon with a different EV yield total between each of its forms, with Normal having one, Terastal having four, and Stellar having three.",
    "While Terapagos as a species has a 50-50 gender ratio, the only Terapagos encounter is set to always be male. Because of this, a female Terapagos cannot currently be legitimately obtained.",
    "Terapagos cannot have its Tera Type be changed under normal circumstances in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet. If the game is modified to force Terapagos to have a different Tera Type, the game will lag significantly while Terastallizing; however, unlike with Ogerpon, the game will not softlock. Illusion will also not work if either Terapagos or the Pokémon with said Ability Terastallize.",
    "Terapagos is the only Pokémon in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet that is able to learn moves through TMs, but cannot learn Tera Blast (despite the move using Terastal energy, which Terapagos is responsible for creating).",
    "Terapagos's cry is almost identical to the sound that is made when a Pokémon Terastallizes. The cry also incorporates the leitmotif commonly associated in-game with Area Zero, Terapagos's habitat. It is more easily distinguished when the cry is played at slower speed.",
    "Normal Form Terapagos is tied with Azurill and Shroodle for being the shortest Normal-type Pokémon.",
    "Terapagos is the only Pokémon to have three signature Abilities, the most out of any Pokémon.",
    "One of Stellar Form Terapagos's attack animations has it use the 18 hexagonal gems orbiting its dome to form a symbol and shoot the attack from it. This symbol is the very same one featured in The Hidden Treasure of Area Zero expansion's logo.",
    "While in game, Terapagos is categorized as the Tera Pokémon, in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet's official website, it is categorized as the Terastal Pokémon.",
    "If Terapagos uses auto-battle to defeat a Pokémon, it'll transform into its Terastal Form before defeating the wild Pokémon, and then switch back to its Normal Form.",
    "Despite being the source of the Terastal phenomenon, which contains the power of every type, Terapagos cannot learn any Ghost- or Flying-type moves.",
    "Terapagos is the only Pokémon with an EV yield total of more than three, with its Terastal Form having a total of four. Terapagos is also the only Pokémon with a different EV yield total between each of its forms, with Normal having one, Terastal having four, and Stellar having three."
