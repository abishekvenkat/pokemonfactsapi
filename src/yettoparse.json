    "Before the official reveal of Terapagos, a sketch of its Stellar Form appeared in the Scarlet BookS/Violet BookV, drawn by Heath in Pokemon Scarlet and Violet.",
    "Terapagos has several similarities to Eternatus. Both are Legendary Pokemon that are responsible for the special type of transformation (Dynamax/Gigantamax and Terastallization) found within their respective regions of origin (Galar and Paldea) after entering a state of dormancy sometime in the distant past. They also both have transformations exclusive to them related to these phenomena increasing their stats (Eternatus's Eternamax form and Terapagos's Stellar Form, though the former is unobtainable) and can absorb the energy needed to use these transformations from other Pokemon, thereby rendering them unavailable. They also each have a form that cannot be used by the player in battle with programmed stats (Eternatus's Eternamax form and Terapagos's Normal form, the latter of which can be brought into battle but not used due to its unsurpressable ability). Both of them were also introduced in a game which would receive DLC and whose game mascots comprise a Legendary duo.",
    "In the closed captions of the initial TV Tokyo broadcast of HZ023, Terapagos was mistakenly referred to as „Ç≥„ÉÄ„Ç§„Ç´„É° Kodaikame (from Âè§‰ª£‰∫Ä kodaikame, literally \"\"ancient turtle\"\").[10][11] This mirrors its internal name from Pokemon Scarlet and Violet, where Terapagos is also referred to as \"\"kodaikame\"\".",

    "While Terapagos as a species has a 50-50 gender ratio, the only Terapagos encounter is set to always be male. Because of this, a female Terapagos cannot currently be legitimately obtained.",
    "Terapagos cannot have its Tera Type be changed under normal circumstances in Pokemon Scarlet and Violet. If the game is modified to force Terapagos to have a different Tera Type, the game will lag significantly while Terastallizing; however, unlike with Ogerpon, the game will not softlock. Illusion will also not work if either Terapagos or the Pokemon with said Ability Terastallize.",
    "Terapagos is the only Pokemon in Pokemon Scarlet and Violet that is able to learn moves through TMs, but cannot learn Tera Blast (despite the move using Terastal energy, which Terapagos is responsible for creating).",
    "Terapagos's cry is almost identical to the sound that is made when a Pokemon Terastallizes. The cry also incorporates the leitmotif commonly associated in-game with Area Zero, Terapagos's habitat. It is more easily distinguished when the cry is played at slower speed.",

    "While in game, Terapagos is categorized as the Tera Pokemon, in Pokemon Scarlet and Violet's official website, it is categorized as the Terastal Pokemon.",
    "If Terapagos uses auto-battle to defeat a Pokemon, it'll transform into its Terastal Form before defeating the wild Pokemon, and then switch back to its Normal Form.",
    "Despite being the source of the Terastal phenomenon, which contains the power of every type, Terapagos cannot learn any Ghost- or Flying-type moves.",
