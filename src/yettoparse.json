They are both event-exclusive Paradox Pokemon with signature moves that can be caught only once per save file based on a Legendary Pokemon that is a member of a Legendary trio. Despite being based on Legendary Pokemon, they are both not considered Legendary Pokemon themselves. They are the first Paradox Pokemon that can be encountered in a Tera Raid Battle and were both revealed and released simultaneously in the same Poke Portal News event and software update. They were both teased in the Scarlet BookS/Violet BookV, though neither of them appear in any editions of Occulture magazine. Prior to the release of The Indigo Disk, their Pokedex entries in Pokemon HOME were both only three words long and shared between Scarlet and Violet, but have been since replaced. Iron Leaves, Walking Wake, and Pecharunt are also the only Pokemon that can be registered but are not required for the completion of the Blueberry Pokedex.",

    "Terapagos has several similarities to Eternatus. Both are Legendary Pokemon that are responsible for the special type of transformation (Dynamax/Gigantamax and Terastallization) found within their respective regions of origin (Galar and Paldea) after entering a state of dormancy sometime in the distant past. They also both have transformations exclusive to them related to these phenomena increasing their stats (Eternatus's Eternamax form and Terapagos's Stellar Form, though the former is unobtainable) and can absorb the energy needed to use these transformations from other Pokemon, thereby rendering them unavailable. They also each have a form that cannot be used by the player in battle with programmed stats (Eternatus's Eternamax form and Terapagos's Normal form, the latter of which can be brought into battle but not used due to its unsurpressable ability). Both of them were also introduced in a game which would receive DLC and whose game mascots comprise a Legendary duo.",
